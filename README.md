# PyWirelessTransfer
Useful for transfering files between old and new PCs (which is also the exact reason I wrote this).

# Usage
---
## Python
It's all written with the standard Python 3.9 library (Python versions 3.x should run the code fine), so just clone the repo with
```
git clone https://github.com/SeanJxie/PyWirelessTransfer
```
and run
```
py main.py
```
to get started.

---
## EXE
If you don't feel like doing what is shown above, just download `PyWirelessTransfer.exe` and run (if you trust me).
