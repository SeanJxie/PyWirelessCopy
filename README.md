# PyWirelessTransfer
Useful for transferring files between old and new PCs when wires are expensive and unobtainable (which is also the exact reason I wrote this).
Directory structure is maintained through the transfer, so no need to worry about rearranging/renaming files.

*Note: Currently rewritting the entire script as things are too buggy...

# Usage
---
## Python
It's all written with the standard Python 3.9 library (Python versions 3.x should run the code fine), so just clone the repo with
```
git clone https://github.com/SeanJxie/PyWirelessTransfer
```
and run
```
py main.py
```
to get started.

---
## EXE
If you don't feel like doing what is shown above, download [`PyWirelessTransfer.exe`](https://github.com/SeanJxie/PyWirelessTransfer/blob/main/PyWirelessTransfer.exe?raw=true) and run to get started (if you trust me)!
