# PyWirelessTransfer
Useful for transfering files between old and new PCs (which is also the exact reason I wrote this).

# Usage
It's all written with the standard Python 3.9 library (Python versions 3.x should run the code fine), so just clone the repo with
```
git clone https://github.com/SeanJxie/PyWirelessTransfer
```
and run
```
py main.py
```
to get started.
