# PyWirelessTransfer
Useful for transferring files between old and new PCs when wires are expensive and unobtainable (which is also the exact reason I wrote this).
Directory structure is maintained through the transfer, so no need to worry about rearranging/renaming files.

# Usage
---
## Python
It's all written with the standard Python 3.9 library (Python versions 3.x should run the code fine), so just clone the repo with
```
git clone https://github.com/SeanJxie/PyWirelessTransfer
```
Or, you can download the source code from "[Releases](https://github.com/SeanJxie/PyWirelessTransfer/releases/tag/v1.0)", extract the code, and run
```
py main.py
```
to get started.

## EXE
If you don't feel like doing what is shown above, download [`PyWirelessTransfer.exe`](https://github.com/SeanJxie/PyWirelessTransfer/releases/download/v1.0/PyWirelessTransfer.exe)  from "[Releases](https://github.com/SeanJxie/PyWirelessTransfer/releases/tag/v1.0)" and run to get started (if you trust me)!
